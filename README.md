_**Types of Digital Marketing**_

There are as many specializations within digital marketing as there are ways of interacting using digital media. The various forms of digital marketing are presented below:

**Search Engine Optimization**

Search engine optimization, or SEO, is technically a marketing tool rather than a form of marketing. The Balance defines it as “the art and science of making web pages attractive to search engines.”
SEO is a science because it requires you to research and weigh different contributing factors to achieve the highest possible ranking. The most important elements to consider when optimizing a web page include:

	Quality of content

	Level of user engagement

	Mobile friendliness

	Number and quality of inbound links

The strategic use of these factors makes SEO a science, but the unpredictability involved makes it an art. In SEO, there's no consistent rule for ranking high. So, the user can closely monitor their page's performance and adjust accordingly.

**Content Marketing**

SEO is a major factor in content marketing, a strategy based on the distribution of relevant and valuable content to a target audience.
Content marketing aims to attract leads that ultimately convert into customers. As opposed to traditional advertising enticing prospects with potential value from a product or service, content marketing offers value for free in the form of written material. Content marketing writers must be able to rank highly in search engine results. They must engage the target audience with the material, share it, and interact further with the brand. Strong relationships can be established when relevant content is being churned out.

**Social Media Marketing**

Social Media marketing refers to the art of creating brand awareness by engaging people online. Social media marketing involves active audience participation. It has become a popular way of getting attention. The most popular platforms for social media marketing are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with LinkedIn and YouTube not far behind.
According to the Content Marketing Institute, 61% of B2B content marketers increased their use of social media this year. Social media marketing offers built-in engagement metrics, which are extremely useful in helping you to understand how well you're reaching your audience. You get to decide which types of interactions mean the most to you, whether that means the number of shares, comments, or total clicks to your website.

**Pay-per-click marketing**

Pay-per-click, or PPC, is posting an ad on a platform and paying every time someone clicks on it.
When a spot is available on a search engine results page, the engine fills the spot with what is essentially an instant auction. An algorithm prioritizes each available ad based on several factors, including:
	Ad quality
	Keyword relevance
	Landing page quality
	Bid amount
Each PPC campaign has 1 or more target actions that viewers are meant to complete after clicking an ad. These actions are known as conversions, and they can be transactional or non-transactional. Making a purchase is a conversion, but so is a newsletter signup or a call made to the customer.
The target conversions can be tracked via preferred platform to assess 

**Affiliate marketing**

Affiliate marketing enables advertisers to earn money by promoting another person's business. Affiliate marketing is based on a revenue sharing model. 
The advertiser promoting the business is called the affiliate and the owner of the business allowing the promotion of their business is referred to as the merchant or retailer. 
The affiliate gets a commission every time someone purchases the promoted item. The merchant pays the affiliate for every sale they helped make. An affiliate can promote more than one merchant’s business at a time. 

**Native advertising**

Native advertising is marketing in disguise. The aim is to ensure that the product is marketed by blending along with the surroundings. This form of advertising came into picture after regular advertising stopped drawing abundant attention and seemed biased since creator of an ad pays to run it. A native ad gets around this bias by offering information or entertainment before it gets to anything promotional, downplaying the ad aspect. It’s important to always label your native ads clearly. Use words like “promoted” or “sponsored.” If the readers aren’t informed appropriately, they might end up spending significant time engaging with the content before they realize that it's advertising.
When your consumers know exactly what they're getting, they'll feel better about your content and your brand. Native ads are meant to be less obtrusive than traditional ads, but they’re not meant to be deceptive.

**Marketing automation**

Marketing automation uses software to power digital marketing campaigns, improving the efficiency and relevance of advertising. Marketing automation lets companies keep up with the expectation of personalization. It allows brands to:
•	Collect and analyze consumer information
•	Design targeted marketing campaigns
•	Send and post marketing messages at the right times to the right audiences
Many marketing automation tools use prospect engagement with a particular message to determine when and how to reach out next. This level of real-time customization means that you can effectively create an individualized marketing strategy for each customer without any additional time investment.

**Email Marketing**

Promotional messages sent to prospective customers via email is referred to as Email Marketing. Advertiser must keep the following points in mind when opting for Email Marketing 
•	Individualizes the content, both in the body and in the subject line
•	States clearly what kind of emails the subscriber will get
•	Offers a clear unsubscribe option
•	Integrates both transactional and promotional emails
Email marketing is a proven, effective technique all on its own: 89% of surveyed professionals named  it as their most effective lead generator. It can be even better if you incorporate other techniques such as marketing automation, which lets you segment and schedule your emails so that they meet your customer's needs more effectively.
